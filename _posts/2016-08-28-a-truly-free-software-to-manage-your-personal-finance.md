# A Truly Free Software to Manage Your Personal Finance

Free Personal Finance Software (aka. FPFS) is a free program that helps you manage your personal finance.

## Our origin story

We believe that good money habit is an important life skill that many people are not cultivating. As software developers and avid money people ourselves, we believe in the power of awareness, i.e. "whatever that can me measured, can be improved". In the world of software, this translates to building tools that allow you to look behind the bank statements and hear the stories your dollars are telling you.

## Why free?

We believe that everyone should have access to good personal finance software. Also

## What kind of free?

Our software is free as in free beer, i.e. with a $0 price tag. However, this is not all we mean by "free".

As hackers, we believe in openness and the power of community. Upon release, our software will also be open-sourced so that any interested parties can inspect and improve upon. The only request we make is that any modifications are also contributed back to the community (in a GPL manner).

By staying true to the idea of free, we want this project to be protected against future \_tk\_

## If everything is free, how do you make money?

Good question! We are glad you asked.

We won't shy away from revealing our financial masterplan of creating a financially-sustainable business out of our money-management passion (Quiz: How many time did we mention money?). Here are some of our ideas moving forward:

* Create, sell and support "power packs", which enables you do more with the platform, e.g. importing transaction directly from your bank.
* We will build backend services (which cost money to run and support) that let you to share access to the same financial account is a secure manner. For example, you can grant your accountant **read-only** access to your transactions and financial reports of one **particular time period**.
* Create a marketplace where developers can share and sell plugins that extends the functionalities of our core product. We can profit by making a small commission out of every sales (everyone wins).

## Sound great! Where can I get this?

Here, of course!

But a bit more time is needed before this awesome program is open-to-all.

We are still beta-testing our core product between ourselves (the developers), friends and families. We will be rolling out private invitations in the next few months for the money and tech enthusiasts before opening the door to the public. We know that you are as excited about this as we are so please trust us it is going to be worth the wait.
