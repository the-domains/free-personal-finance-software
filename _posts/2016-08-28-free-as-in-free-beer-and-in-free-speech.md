Our software is free as in free beer, i.e. with a $0 price tag. However, this is not all we mean by "free".

As hackers, we believe in openness and the power of community. Upon release, our software will also be open-sourced so that any interested parties can inspect and improve upon. The only request we make is that modifications are also contributed back to the community (in a GPL-like manner).
